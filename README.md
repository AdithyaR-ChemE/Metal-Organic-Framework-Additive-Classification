# Metal-Organic-Framework-Additive-Classification
This project applies machine learning to classify the solvent category used in the synthesis of Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) based on synthesis data.
The aim is to explore how predictive models can support researchers in accelerating MOF discovery and synthesis planning.

ðŸ“Š Dataset
~500 synthesis entries collected from published literature
Each row contains MOF synthesis parameters and the corresponding solvent/additive used

ðŸ§  Methodology
Model: Feed-forward neural network classifier
Frameworks: (replace with what you used â†’ e.g. Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch)
Evaluation metrics: Precision, Recall, and F1-score

ðŸ“ˆ Results
Precision: 0.757
Recall: 0.759
F1-score: 0.757


ðŸ“Œ Note
The dataset is relatively small (~500 rows), so performance may improve with more data or feature engineering.
The project demonstrates the feasibility of using machine learning in MOF synthesis workflows.
